# T-Shirt Mockup Configurator Prototype

This is a prototype for an application that enables a user to position a t-shirt design on a t-shirt mockup, complete with "multiply" blending, a displacement map, and numerous other configurations to achieve a realistic mockup.

## Inspiration

This repo, as it exists today, is a heavily modified forked version of the "Hover Effect" repo built by Robin Delaporte. You can find his original work here: https://github.com/robin-dela/hover-effect.

## Future Work

This is just a prototype. I plan to continue work here to morph this into either a library that can be distributed to other developers who need a similar feature set, OR a working product for end-users.

## Use locally

Pull the repo down to your local machine, `npm install` and host a local server via python. Simply go to the demo's folder location and type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in your terminal. Then access the app in your browser by typing: `localhost:8000`.

To make changes, utilize `npm run watch` to preview changes live in your browser.
